//In applications with many components, it’s very important to free up resources taken by the components when they are destroyed.

 //when the component is rendered to the DOM for the first time. This is called “mounting” in React.
 
 // when we want to clear to DOM produced by the rendering of the component/ mounting . this is called unmounting in react
 
 when component mounts:
  componentDidMount() {
  }
  The componentDidMount() method runs after the component output has been rendered to the DOM. 
  
  
  when component unmounts:
   componentWillUnmount() {
  }

State
// Wrong
this.state.comment = 'Hello';

// Correct
this.setState({comment: 'Hello'});
The only place where you can assign this.state is the constructor.
